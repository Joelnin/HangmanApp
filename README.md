# Overview

This project is a fully functional **Hangman game** developed for Android.  
The goal was to strengthen my skills in Android development, Kotlin programming, and object-oriented design by building an interactive mobile app.

The app challenges the user to guess a hidden word by selecting letters. Each incorrect guess reduces the remaining attempts and updates the hangman drawing. The game ends when the word is fully guessed (win) or when all attempts are used (lose).

**How to use the app:**
- Launch the app, press Play in the first screen, and select a word bank category (Topic: Animals, Nature, Objects, or Random).
- Tap letters on the screen to guess the hidden word.
- The hangman drawing updates when incorrect guesses are made.
- The game will display a win screen if the word is guessed, or a loss screen if attempts run out.
- From the end screen, you can restart the game and select the topic again, or return to the main menu.

The purpose of creating this app was to gain experience with Android UI components, activity navigation, and state management in Kotlin, while also reinforcing clean code practices and documentation.
